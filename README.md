This is a project to build an inventory of the items in my home. This will track consumables to help me manage when I need to buy new items, help me with grocery planning and cooking by lookig at the ingredients I have and comparing it to recipies. 
Non-consumable items will be tracked for insurance purposes in case of theft or damages. Will also track insurance policies on said non-consumables.
